# Terraform Homework and Pet Projects

This repository contains my Terraform homework assignments and pet projects. The directory structure is organized based on different cloud providers.


## Usage

Each directory under the provider folders (e.g., Azure, GCP, AWS) contains subdirectorys with Terraform script related to a task or project. The subdirectory name reflects the purpose or description of the Terraform script.

To use a specific Terraform script, navigate to the respective directory and follow the instructions provided in the corresponding `README.md` file.
